## pandera-basics

This repo contains code that demonstrates most basic uses of the `pandera` package.

1. Folders `src` and the script `example.py` contain very simple 
code that performs some checks on the data loaded from files in `data`
2. Jupyter notebook `pandera_intro.ipynb` contains review of basic use cases
of `pandera`


DISCLAIMER: data in the folder `data` was downloaded from 
[stooq.com](stooq.com). I do not own the data. It is used here 
for non-commercial purposes.
